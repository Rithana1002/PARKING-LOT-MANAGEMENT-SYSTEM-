About This Project:
    This project is a Java-based Parking Lot Management System designed to demonstrate the implementation of core Java concepts in a structured and practical way.
    The application manages basic parking operations such as vehicle entry, slot allocation, vehicle exit, and ticket tracking.
    The system follows a layered design using separate packages for entities, services, utilities, and the main application, ensuring clean code organization and maintainability.
    Custom exceptions are used to handle error scenarios gracefully, improving reliability and readability.
